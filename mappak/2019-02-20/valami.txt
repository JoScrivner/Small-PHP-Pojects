<b>PHP Calendar Introduction</b>
The calendar extension contains functions that simplifies converting between different calendar formats.
It is based on the Julian Day Count, which is a count of days starting from January 1st, 4713 B.C.
Note: To convert between calendar formats, you must first convert to Julian Day Count, then to the calendar of your choice.
Note: The Julian Day Count is not the same as the Julian Calendar!
